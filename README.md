Write the code to provide a comparative analysis of Titles 16, 45, and 48 using the SHAMROQ framework. 
This paper offers multiple key contributions. First, we provide a comparative analysis of Titles 16, 45, and 48 using the SHAMROQ framework. This will highlight the differences, similarities, and unique challenges each title presents when it comes to regulatory text complexity. The insights derived from this comparison would be invaluable for practitioners working across these titles. Second, we expand SHAMROQ's framework. Our prior research  [10] validated CFR Title 48.  In this research we illustrate its adaptability and application across different CFR titles. This will underscore the versatility of SHAMROQ and pave the way for its wider application across various regulatory domains. 

Next, we provide deeper insights into regulatory language complexity by expanding the analysis to include multiple titles.  The aim is to provide a richer understanding of the variability in deontic language usage across different regulatory contexts. This would be crucial for developing more robust regulatory analytics and compliance systems that can handle diverse regulatory environments. Finally, we enhanced knowledge in software engineering and regulatory compliance, this manuscript can further solidify the position of SHAMROQ and its methodologies in the academic literature. By presenting new challenges, solutions, and insights, it can guide future research and practical applications in the realm of regulatory analytics and compliance.
